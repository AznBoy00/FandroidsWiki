Conway cited it as justification for a travel and immigration ban from seven Muslim-majority countries enacted by United States President Donald Trump. However, no such massacre occurred. The day after the interview, Conway said she misspoke and had been referring to the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky on charges including \"attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to al-Qaeda in Iraq\". She stated that she had mentioned the incident because it led President Barack Obama to tighten immigration procedures for Iraqi citizens.\nThe misstatement went viral and became the top trending topic on Twitter, with many tweets parodying it.",
